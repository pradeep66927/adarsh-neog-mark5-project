            <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">There are many problems in the rest of the 
                country as well as in India one of them is unemployment . it is not a good situation
                for job seeker but nowadays situation becomes more bad when corona started 
                their leg spread, if we talk about unemployment what is it , simple we 
                we can defined that when a person want to do work according to his skill
                in minimal paid rate but he does not get the work for his survival due 
                to that his family as well as himself reached in the  condition of starvation
                or he compromise to work with no condition whether he is skilled in that
                work or not. 
                    creation of unemployment in different sector is different type like 
                if we talk about education sector , in indian education system there 
                is no essurance of getting job after completing our degree because many
                subject is not job or skill oriented subject we complete our degree or 
                course but at the end we get no job because during the degree we learn
                only theories not a skill on the base of we can find a job for our 
                servival so one of the cause of unemployment is not having a skilled based  
                education system but recently there is good news for our new generation because
                because indian government is decided to introduced a new education policy
                which is new "national education policy 2020" is approved by the union cabinet
                of india on july 28th,2020 but due to strike of corona pandemic
                implementation of this policy became some difficult but as corona problem
                ended government will proceed toward this.
                     more population is also a problem for unemployment because there is limited
                of job vacancy but  job seeker is multiple times of job vacancy this can be seen
                in government job sector a forth class job group-D ,government out a notification 
                for job vacancy of 1,03,769 post but against of this vacancy student apply over 
                1.15 crore candidate are applied ,according to a government date for this 
                forth class job many b.tech degree holder is also applied for this job so unemployment
                rate can be understand by this one example.
                      instead of these type of competition there are many problem is happening due 
                to unemployment like many state people like bihar,jharkhand,up etc 
                they migrate in search of job and they are compel to live far from their
                family and their local land.but government is not taking step toward providing  a job
                in their local place.

                    these all unemployment condition can be converted into opportunity by stepping some 
                step by government or people as we know that india has most number of youth power in 
                the world we only need to change our population into work force that will change this 
                developing india to developed india, government should take some step toward
                1.change in education system.
                2.expansion of employment exchanges.
                3.more assistance to self employed people.
                4.change in industrial technique.
